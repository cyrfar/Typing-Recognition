# Typing-Recognition-
A very simple typing recognition notebook. Simply run 

user = collect_data('type anything here')

to collect typing data (typing times for different twograms) for a each user. Then run

test_program([user1, user2], 'type anything here')

and make one of the users type. The program should then guess which user typed the test.
